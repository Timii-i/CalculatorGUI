### Description

CalculatorGUI is a university project in which we had a calcualtor for the command line and had to build a gui (graphical user interface) for it. The calculator is written in Java and we used JavaFX to build the gui.

Mathematical functions available in the calculator:
* Addition (+) 
* Subtraction (-)
* Division (/)
* Multiplication (*)
* Exponentiation (^)
* Modulo (%)
* Square root (sqrt())
* Sine (sin())
* Cosine (cos())
* Tangent (tan())
* Factorial (fac())
* Logarithm base 10 (log())
* Logarithm base e (ln())
* Pi (pi)
* Euler's number (e)
